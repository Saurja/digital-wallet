<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [PoppyJS](https://apvarun.github.io/poppyjs)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Saurja/digital-wallet
```
2. Install Composer packages
```sh
composer install
```
3. Use the database_dw.sql file to get the code for the database and paste it in your phpmyadmin sql query entry
4. Edit the config.php and transactionConfig.php routing them to your MySQL Database


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Digital Wallet is a payment application that allows users to store and spend virtual money. This project does not use real money and only for educational purposes.

There are applications like an online bank account where users can have a wallet to store their money and spend from there. Users can also use vouchers or request money from others.

Users can have different ways to send or receive money which gives them a wide variety of possibilities while making a transaction. User has the choice of signing up via multiple authentication processes which makes the app more smoothe and secure.


### Things we have to keep in mind
* how a real digital payment system works
* how a transaction happens
* how to log detailed transactions
* Understand requirements
* write User Stories and do Estimation
* Develop & Test System

### Screens in this project
* Login/Registration Screen
* Send Money
* Request Money
* Vouchers
* View Transactions
