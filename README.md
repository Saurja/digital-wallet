#Project Overview

Digital Wallet is a payment application that allows users to store and spend virtual money. This project does not use real money and only for educational purposes.

There are applications like an online bank account where users can have a wallet to store their money and spend from there. Users can also recharge your wallet or receive money from others.

Users can have different ways to send or receive money which gives them a wide variety of possibilities while making a transaction. User has the choice of signing up via multiple authentication platforms which makes the process smoother.
