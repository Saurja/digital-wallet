There are applications like an online bank account where users can have a wallet to store their money and spend from there. Users can also use vouchers or request money from others.

Users can have different ways to send or receive money which gives them a wide variety of possibilities while making a transaction. User has the choice of signing up via multiple authentication processes which makes the app more smoothe and secure.
